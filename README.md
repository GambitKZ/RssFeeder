# Summary

I just wanted an App that build RSS for me.

Build on "https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture" Template.

## Structure

I plan the following structure:

- MVP - a simple example on which I will do the rest of the work
- Domain - hold domain logic
- Application - hold logic, Interfaces, etc.
- Presentation.AzureFunction - API on base of the Azure Function
- Infrastructure.AzureStorage - Database (Table) on base of Azure Storage

# Description
